# Pinned Core-to-Cloud capability map

AF-CLD-003. Map schema 1; planning evidence inventory, **not product or release acceptance**.

The [machine-readable map](upstream-capability-map.json) covers all **67 Cloud tasks** and **42 AF-GC requirements**. It fixes one implementation owner, an upstream version, a reuse decision, evidence limitations and a concrete integration acceptance scenario for every Cloud capability. The original manifests retain their IDs, dependencies and proposed labels. Merged changes and their review evidence record engineering delivery; consumer and release acceptance require their own evidence.

## Versions and evidence boundaries

- Core baseline: [`d097ac0b04445183c647012a0c92a9d6348135b6`](https://github.com/HappyMiha/AgentFactory/tree/d097ac0b04445183c647012a0c92a9d6348135b6); [42-task manifest](https://github.com/HappyMiha/AgentFactory/blob/d097ac0b04445183c647012a0c92a9d6348135b6/examples/game-creator-backlog.json).
- Cloud planning baseline (refreshed after development-workflow metadata cleanup; product criteria unchanged): [`39dd3030acd642dccec30abebdd7ce6caf0a2ec8`](https://github.com/HappyMiha/AgentFactory-Cloud/tree/39dd3030acd642dccec30abebdd7ce6caf0a2ec8); [67-task manifest](https://github.com/HappyMiha/AgentFactory-Cloud/blob/39dd3030acd642dccec30abebdd7ce6caf0a2ec8/examples/agentfactory-cloud-backlog.json).
- Supported integration interface: **unqualified at this pin**. Godot, Unity and Unreal pack versions are **unknown**, represented by `null`. A Core commit is a reproducible source reference; it is not a supported engine/toolchain/profile declaration. AF-CLD-002/005/006 must establish those contracts and evidence.
- Every capability's `core_version` repeats the exact Core pin. `source-inventory` evidence identifies existing source and test definitions. Resolving these Git blobs does not execute the tests or demonstrate the described product behavior.
- The separate merged engineering records cover Core AF-GC-001 (portable CI), AF-GC-003 (confirmation behavior) and AF-GC-006 (effective model binding). They do not complete the full game journey, role qualification or Cloud integration. PR5 later made the Python matrix manual-only; skipped matrix jobs are not passing executions.
- The September product audit predates those three engineering repairs. Its unresolved consumer/engine/hosting findings remain relevant; its historical fixed-bug findings are not used to deny the recorded repairs.

`verified` would require accepted evidence for an exact supported version and profile. This snapshot contains **no verified Cloud capability**. `partial` means a reusable foundation or reviewed engineering repair exists but the listed integration remains unaccepted. `missing` means the required capability outcome lacks accepted implementation evidence at the baseline. `blocked` identifies an external prerequisite, currently console partner qualification. Missing evidence is not evidence that every related source module is absent.

Each `integration_test` is a concrete acceptance scenario with status `not-accepted`. This means no accepted result is supplied by this map; it does not assert that no one has ever attempted the test. Local map regression tests validate this planning artifact, not the games, providers, hosted deployment or commercial workflows in these scenarios.

## Ownership and reuse decisions

`implementation_owner` names the single destination of the capability, not the repository containing its historical task ID. `Core` owns neutral mechanisms; `Core.Packs` owns optional adapters/templates/target operations outside the scheduler. `Cloud.Platform`, `Cloud.Games`, `Cloud.Community` and `Cloud.Marketplace` are modules of one Cloud repository. Cloud remains the consumer and accepts its own integration.

For example, Cloud 011/014/052 consume Core-owned engine/validator/SDK work; they must not create a second engine implementation in Cloud. Cloud 053 consumes the Core Unity adapter, while the complete consumer Unity journey remains a Cloud acceptance reference. Implement an upstream capability through a focused change or pull request in its owning repository, then link the reviewed evidence from the Cloud integration. The map assigns responsibility without creating new task IDs or taking ownership of future work.

Decisions mean: **reuse** an already sufficient contract after consumer qualification; **extend** an existing foundation in its owning repository; **migrate** Creator presentation responsibility to Cloud through supported Core contracts, preserving existing operator behavior; **build** a currently unqualified capability at the named owner. No row claims unconditional reuse is already sufficient. These decisions do not authorize deleting or moving current source.

Core retains scheduling, retries, provider execution, generic evidence, worktrees, accepted source identities and provenance mechanics. Cloud owns hosted account boundaries, customer policy, public release, legal-rights decisions and commerce. **AF-CLD-043 is the single shared Cloud rights-policy capability** used by export, remix, Community and Marketplace; those consumers do not each implement a competing rights service. Core provenance records do not establish legal title.

## Cloud traceability table

Full planned test scenarios, gaps and pinned evidence identifiers are in the corresponding JSON records. An empty upstream list means no direct AF-GC requirement implements that product outcome; the listed generic foundations may still be useful.

## Review of every upstream requirement

These are responsibility and evidence assessments at the pin. “Merged” means the identified engineering change was integrated with a review; it is not a product-release state. Proposed requirements are not promoted merely because a module or a similarly named historical task exists. Forward links in Cloud rows and reverse consumer links in the JSON must agree.

## Milestone-specific acceptance links

These are evidence references, **not executable scheduling dependencies**:

- **AF-GC-026 → Godot:** AF-CLD-020 demonstrates the real reference-game journey; AF-CLD-034 adds hosted tenant and operational qualification. Core lower-level capabilities are accepted independently before Cloud integrates them. Do not demand an already accepted duplicate Godot journey as a prerequisite for the Cloud journey that supplies its evidence.
- **AF-GC-031 → local/hybrid:** AF-CLD-063 qualifies offered model/routing choices and AF-CLD-065 qualifies deployment/data placement. Neither blocks the first Cloud-first Godot result. Local-only must prove no cloud egress.
- **AF-GC-034 → Unity:** AF-CLD-053 qualifies its adapter and AF-CLD-060 accepts the advertised multi-engine matrix. Unity does not block Godot or require blanket completion of all AF-GC tasks.
- **AF-GC-037 → export/share:** AF-CLD-016 covers the initial Windows/source export, AF-CLD-032 the portable ownership package, and AF-CLD-039 explicit sharing controls. Private export is not public publication.

Cloud executable dependencies remain exactly its canonical manifest. Upstream dependency edges remain references within the upstream manifest. There is no reverse Core scheduling edge to Cloud release acceptance. The validator checks both DAGs, rejects foreign executable dependencies and checks that the first Godot gate has no later-phase prerequisite. The original AF-GC dependencies are preserved for audit; the bridge does not turn their whole transitive closure into a new Cloud scheduler barrier.

Do not add `AF-CLD-040 → AF-CLD-043`: the manifest already has `043 → 040`. Remix must validate its input rights through the common policy contract; the later provenance/release qualification integrates those checks. The signed GA scope, not this map, determines conditional commerce/target/console/non-game release gates.

## Unresolved integrations

Every capability has its own unresolved gap and required acceptance scenario. Cross-cutting issues are:

- **version-contract** — Cloud.Platform; AF-CLD-002, AF-CLD-005, AF-CLD-006. Agree versioned API/engine/target/evidence contracts, select actual pack versions and pin accepted integration results; this map cannot grant readiness.
- **godot-delivery** — Cloud.Games; AF-CLD-010, AF-CLD-011, AF-CLD-013, AF-CLD-020. Complete Core-owned packs/delivery with their own evidence, then accept real Godot consumer games. Do not wait for Unity or require the same journey twice.
- **hosted-isolation** — Cloud.Platform; AF-CLD-021, AF-CLD-022, AF-CLD-024, AF-CLD-026, AF-CLD-034. Qualify real server resources, PostgreSQL, tenant/account/age boundaries, secret protection and hostile workloads; local SQLite contracts and server availability do not qualify hosting.
- **rights-policy** — Cloud.Platform; AF-CLD-032, AF-CLD-040, AF-CLD-043, AF-CLD-046. Use one Cloud rights decision service with source/asset provenance. Core owns neutral digest/lineage mechanics, not legal rights. Check remix inputs without adding 040 -> 043 and creating a cycle.
- **optional-targets** — Core.Packs; AF-CLD-053, AF-CLD-054, AF-CLD-055, AF-CLD-056, AF-CLD-058, AF-CLD-059, AF-CLD-065. Obtain actual engine/toolchain/hardware/partner evidence only for supported profiles. Local-only requires no-egress proof; Unity and console remain outside the first Godot gate.
- **commercial-and-ga** — Cloud.Platform; AF-CLD-051, AF-CLD-062, AF-CLD-066, AF-CLD-067. Independently approve commercial policy and the signed GA scope with enabled-feature gates. Mapping, simulated payment events and non-game examples cannot approve a release.

## Validation and updating the pin

Run the dependency-free structural checks and mutation regressions:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_upstream_map.py
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_upstream_map.py' -v
```

With an existing local Core clone containing the pinned objects, additionally verify both pinned manifests, upstream titles/dependencies, evidence file blobs and merged-evidence ancestry:

```sh
python3 scripts/validate_upstream_map.py --core-repo /path/to/AgentFactory
```

On Windows use `python`. The optional Git check uses only read commands against local objects. It does not fetch, check out a branch, contact a provider, run engine tests or alter either repository. Missing local objects fail explicitly; fetch through the normal development workflow and retry. A valid map is not a passing integration test or release gate.

When changing Core versions, first review the actual diff and retain the old evidence references. Pin the new Core commit, qualify the relevant interface/pack/toolchain/profile and record independently accepted consumer results. Missing, stale or incompatible evidence keeps the affected integration blocked; retain the previous qualified deployment instead of silently upgrading it. Update all affected rows, the evidence index and this table in one reviewed change. Changes to the allowed accepted-evidence model need explicit schema/validator review; this planning-only schema deliberately rejects unsupported `verified` claims.

Changes to this map must run `python scripts/validate_upstream_map.py` and `test_upstream_map` in a qualified environment. Include their results and the optional pinned-object check in the change review. Passing planning checks does not qualify a consumer integration or release.

## Game-team proposal consumer

AF-CLD-009 role pack 1.0.0 consumes Core `7ec9ff33f1c4e7f2980e4b121d05f3c366acedd1` for RoleRegistry and WorkforceComposer gap assessments. The package dependency uses this newer source pin; the historical catalogue baseline above remains unchanged. This component has empty candidate pools and no execution authority. Current connection resolution, live independent review, work progress and stop integration remain unaccepted. See [game-team component evidence](game-teams.md).

AF-CLD-027 consumes the same accepted Core pin for read-only provider catalogue and eligibility guidance. It supplies no connection/evaluator authority or live qualification; see [connection-guidance.md](connection-guidance.md).
